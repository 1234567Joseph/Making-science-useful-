Evolvability
The framework enables multi-agent systems to continuously evolve by generating data and interacting with environments. This evolution can be driven by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards or supervised learning.

ðŸ“ˆ Scalability
The framework is designed to support systems with millions of agents, ensuring efficient coordination, communication, and resource management at scale.

ðŸ’¾ Statefulness
Agents maintain stateful memory, enabling them to perform multi-step interactions with environments and efficiently tackle sophisticated
